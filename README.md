# leetcodeProblems

Working through Leetcode's programming interview problems to increase my algorithm skills. C++ and Python solutions will be added for each problem.

Included with each solution is a main file that instantiates/calls the solution class, passing in the Example1 test input so you can easily work in your favorite IDE.  For beginners LeetCode's site can feel like a black box where it isn't clear how the solution is being called.
